This repository demonstrates a subtle type-coercion issue in ActionScript 3 when converting a generic object to a Vector.<Object>.  The 'is' operator performs strict type checking, leading to unexpected behavior if the input isn't an Array instance, even if it looks like one (e.g., an object with length and indexed properties).  The solution showcases a safer approach using a loop for better compatibility.
